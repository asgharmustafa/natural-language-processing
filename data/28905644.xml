<title> Chinese cultural analysis</title>
<synopsis> The unit is designed for students with advanced Chinese reading and writing skills. Students will conduct a project-based study of aspects of traditional and modern Chinese culture. It introduces students to the study of Chinese culture, focusing on the characteristics of traditional Chinese culture, the interaction between Chinese culture and other cultures, and the uses to which Chinese culture is put in the modern world. The unit will use a range of Chinese-language and English-language material, sourced from mainland China and internationally. The teaching schedule will consist of bi-weekly two-hour workshops in which students will read and view scholarly publications (in English and Chinese) about Chinese culture, combined with weekly two-hour seminars based on in-depth discussion of the lecture material as it applies to the topics assigned for individual projects. Students will read and analyse materials and commentaries relating to traditional and modern Chinese art and literature and the social and political uses of Chinese culture in China and abroad, guided by the arguments, concepts and methods employed in the field of Chinese cultural studies. By introducing students to a wide range of scholarly materials about Chinese culture, this unit aims to strengthen their academic writing skills.</synopsis>

<title> Geochemistry</title>
<synopsis> Geochemistry concerns itself with the distribution and mobility of elements within the earth and its atmosphere. Over the past decades it has evolved from a descriptive science to one being increasingly concerned with the (molecular-level) mechanisms behind the observations. This unit provides an overview of the fundamental chemical principles that control geochemical processes, and shows how this knowledge can be used to understand, predict, and manage applied geochemical problems, including mineral exploration and geometallurgy; radioactive waste disposal; applied mineralogy and environmental remediation.</synopsis>

<title> Introducing archaeology 1</title>
<synopsis> Archaeology is the study of the material culture (the things) that remain from past communities. In this unit we show you how we recover those remains through archaeological research, and how we can use them to understand the past and its relevance to the present. We examine the cultures of the Mediterranean world (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Iran, and Greece) Asia and Australasia and focus on the period before 1000 BCE. We study the remains of houses, palaces, temples, pottery, tools, weapons, statues, and paintings, and we think about what they can tell us about the way communities organized their societies. We also incorporate the information we learn from written texts as well as from oral histories. Topics include human evolution, origins of farming, the growth of cities, the development of writing, the pyramids of Egypt, the complex societies of the Indus Valley, the Mycenaean kingdoms, and the fall of Troy. Hands-on tutorials explore the archaeological methods used to reconstruct ancient societies.</synopsis>

<title> Managing intercultural communication</title>
<synopsis> The unit examines basic concepts of intercultural communication: face and politeness in language; the relation between cultural values and discourse; cultural variation in speech acts, turn taking rules and formulaic patterns; cultural differences in the organization of written and spoken discourse; and examines their interaction in intercultural communication in the global context. Case studies drawn from a wide variety of cultures will provide opportunities to examine language use in light of broader cultural, political and social issues such as stereotyping and discriminatory language, cultural expectation and attitudes, cultural awareness training, language reform and policies.</synopsis>

<title> Indigenous Australian art, practice and ways of knowing</title>
<synopsis> This unit offers students a synopsis of Indigenous Australian art and practice as a vehicle for the production of knowledge. This unit promotes an examination of Indigenous cultural productions from an Indigenous viewpoint and lens, which enables students to experience not only an acquisition of content of Indigenous practice but through a unique methodological Indigenous approach. Students examine historical and recent cultural productions to learn about their significance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait culture, society and its knowledge economy and its relationship to the broader Australian historical, cultural and political space. Lectures and tutorials provide students with necessary knowledge and a platform to engage with this knowledge in an appropriately ethnographical and experiential way. These lectures provide insight in to Indigenous production in context of pre-colonial history, an imagined post-colonial trajectory through to its interactivity with de-colonisation and the onset of new materialism. Students will develop a deep understanding of the relationality that Indigenous culture has with the premise of Country, its impact on practice and its relationship to their own place and situated experience.</synopsis>

<title> Design strategy and professional practice</title>
<synopsis> This unit develops the capacity to understand and apply the principles and practice of design strategy and will also clarify the professional obligations required of designers. Using investigative processes students will learn the role of design strategy in professional practice and work with industry case studies to develop a greater understanding of strategy in the design process. Design strategy is an intellectual contribution to implementing design briefs and creating relevant and commercially sound visual communication. Professional practice covers the practical business requirements of commercial design studios and students will acquire and participate in negotiation skills, teamwork, written and verbal communication and project management skills across design undertakings large and small that include complex multidisciplinary projects.</synopsis>

<title> Governance of market societies</title>
<synopsis> In the contemporary world the political and economic leaders of capitalist and socialist societies have come to accept that effective governance requires both markets and regulation. But while this consensus exists there is substantial disagreement as regards what constitutes the optimal mix of markets and regulation. In this subject we introduce students to both the system of regulatory capitalism that prevails in the OECD and to the regulatory socialist form of governance that is being created in China. In so doing we explain why the concurrent existence of these two systems of governance have become a source of global tension.</synopsis>

<title> Conflict and coexistence 2: Jews, Christians and Muslims in the modern world</title>
<synopsis> The unit deals with the interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslims from the Enlightenment era to the contemporary period. The historical relationship between these three religious or ethnic groups has sparked considered historical debate and popular misunderstanding. This unit will unpack some of these common assumptions by tracing the evolving relationship between Christians, Muslims, and Jews across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The unit will begin by tracing Enlightenment debates about tolerance and difference that centred around the place of the Jews in modern European nation-states. It will then shift to discussing the social and economic positions of Jews and Muslims in 19th century North Africa, as well as the socio-economic mobility of Jews in 19th century Europe. It will finally move into the twentieth century and cover topics including the emergence of Zionism, the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel, decolonization and the emigration of North African Jews and Muslims to Europe, and contemporary debates about difference in 21st century Europe.</synopsis>

<title> Nations at war: The twentieth century</title>
<synopsis> Although World War I pronounced the death of the nineteenth-century world, the constitutive elements of that period lived on. This unit explores how wars, revolutions, and empires continued to shape the making and re-making of nations - but under new conditions. In particular, we will examine how the interwar crisis of capitalism, decolonization, the Cold War, and our present age of globalization affected the ways in which historical actors reconceived nations and nationalism. Themes covered include the Russian Revolution; Fascism and Nazism; nationalism and revolution in postwar Africa and Asia; religious and market fundamentalisms in the late 20th century. No background knowledge is assumed and students need not have taken Nations at War I.</synopsis>

<title> Translation trends in a digital age</title>
<synopsis> The aim of the unit is to familiarize its participants with the challenges a translator faces when translating multimodal discourse. The unit examines the ways in which textual multimodality affects the translator's work and discusses the impacts of image, word, and sound in different contexts of translation. The unit covers various types of multimodal translation, such as audiovisual translation, audio description, and the translation of different types of illustrated texts. The unit provides students with practical experience of Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tools and other computational resources (such as corpora and terminology tools). The focus on the international and technological framework for translation in a digital age will provide essential introductory knowledge about the localization industry and help students develop expertise in multimodal translation and the associated requirements, sensitivities, and opportunities. Some of the seminars may be taught by guest lecturers.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Semantics is concerned with the meaning of every kind of linguistic constituent and expression in language(from the smallest morphemes and words to complex sentences and texts), as well as the relationships that hold between them. Pragmatics is concerned with how speakers use linguistic forms in particular contexts to communicate more than the semantic content of those forms, as well as how their addressees draw inferences in order to arrive at a shared understanding (or not!). This unit considers the nature of linguistic meaning and how it can be best represented, drawing on natural language data from around the world.</synopsis>

<title> Literary theory</title>
<synopsis> What is the relationship between reading and thinking?. And what are the particular ways of thinking that help and enrich how we read fiction, poetry, drama and literary non-fiction?. Literary theory refers to particular intellectual approaches or frameworks that assist us with understanding, enjoying, constructing meaning from and discussing literary texts. This unit provides a succinct and practical approach to the topic of literary theory. It provides students with the philosophical foundations of modern literary theory, and also with informative and interactive seminars on the contemporary schools of literary theory such as Marxist theory, psychoanalytic theory, poststructuralist theory, feminist theory and postcolonial theory. The unit then instructs the students on how to apply these theoretical approaches to the study of their favourite literary works, and it also provides those students interested in creative writing with the opportunity to develop their own literary and exegetical writings according to the insights of some of the world's major theorists of literature.</synopsis>

<title> Public economics</title>
<synopsis> This unit examines how collective decisions affect the welfare of a society. It will first discuss how free-riding and coordination problems in collective decision making by the citizens, and incentive and credibility problems in the public sector, determine economic policies. It then applies this incentive approach to study how various kinds of interactions between citizens and their government determine social welfare, paying special attention to the importance of voting; political competition; distributional conflicts and institutions in determining collective decision making.</synopsis>

<synopsis> The unit explores how media are adopted, adapted and made use of in different cultural contexts. Contemporary anthropologists understand sociocultural groups as strategic users of media technologies that contribute to ever more novel tools for political self-representation. Media are conceptualized in a broad sense, including traditional mainstream media, small and alternative media, as well as social media. The unit provides an overview of the history of and theories in media anthropology and the specific contributions it can make to the broader field of media studies. It covers topics such as politics of representation, news, nation-building, religion, conflict, indigeneity and media activism. In this unit, we deconstruct common notions of active media producers and passive media recipients and analyse how media practices influence social and cultural dynamics (and the other way around) and question or redefine established social convention.</synopsis>

It aims to help students integrate the diverse discipline knowledge and skills they acquired in prior studies and apply their learning to solve business problems. Students will identify innovative solutions to problems in a simulated experiential environment from a total organisation perspective. In the unit students are expected to bring together all the essential elements of running a business including strategic planning, leadership, ethical decision making, teamwork, cause and effect relationships between functional areas (research and development, marketing, production and finance), satisfying customer demands, and competitive analysis in a simulated learning environment. More specifically, students will learn the value of 'focusing' on the strategic implementation process, understand how decisions in one part of the business impacts other parts of the business, practice decision-making as a team across all key areas of a business, use the information from balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements to improve business decision making, analyse competitors' performance and market positioning and build core competencies within the business to take a differentiation or low cost position in the marketplace.</synopsis>

<title> The archaeology of world rock art</title>
<synopsis> A major way that archaeologists make sense of the past is through the images that people depicted on rocks and on cave walls: rock art is one of the most common, and most visually impressive kind of archaeological evidence. In this unit students will learn about the history of modern humans from 60,000-40,000 years ago into recent times across the world, through the symbols and artworks they made and used. They will learn about what cave art looks like across different regions of the world and from different periods of time, and the different kinds of theories and approaches that archaeologists have employed to try to make sense of this imagery. They will learn and be encouraged to reflect about how those theories concern not just 'other' cultures past and present, but also how they reflect on the preconceptions of the researchers themselves and their own cultures. Students will cover a range of topics from the earliest years of the discipline of archaeology to the latest writings on human symbolic behaviour, and from the Ice Age to more recent artworks.</synopsis>

<title> Introducing archaeology 2</title>
<synopsis> This unit examines how archaeological and historical evidence can be used to study territorial and cultural expansion in the past. We focus on the development of the first empires in the Mediterranean including Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Athens, Macedonia of Alexander the Great, and Rome as well as the original spread of settlements in Australia and the Pacific. We explore how archaeological remains and historical texts can be used to study the movement of people and ideas and to identify the tactics states use to expand, strengthen, and celebrate their power, including military conquest, colonisation, trade, art, and literature. We examine the military ideology of the Assyrians, the internationalism of the Persians, the culture of classical Athens that built the Parthenon, the sweeping conquests of Alexander the Great, the hybrid culture of Kleopatra's Egypt, and the economic-military power of Rome under Caesar and Augustus. Hands-on tutorials explore the archaeological and historical methods used to reconstruct complex ancient societies.</synopsis>

<title> Writing about music: Headlines and hashtags</title>
<synopsis> What is the role of the music writer? What prompts individuals to write about music? What skills does one require to become a successful music writer? This unit explores the rise of writing about music, and the many personalities who have long aspired to be the arbiters of taste, the keepers of standards and, in some instances, even the philosophers of their craft. Such writers have plied their trade in newspapers, journals, books, and, more recently, social media including Facebook and Twitter. By investigating key debates that have often sparked controversy and notoriety, the unit examines the role and function of music critics, broadcasters, journalists, philosophers, academics, magazine writers and bloggers, considering the agency that such individuals have exerted in the media past and present. In addition, students have the opportunity to develop key writing skills and produce work in print and digital forms.</synopsis>

<title> Contemporary feminisms in Asia</title>
<synopsis> This unit as a whole explores what constitutes feminist knowledges and practices in Asia. As feminisms are historically 'western-centred', the unit considers the ways in which these resonate with lived realities in Asia. As such, feminist knowledges and practices of 'women of colour' (e.g. feminist-postcolonial thought) are privileged in this unit. Highly interdisciplinary in its concerns, the unit examines fluid and contextual characteristics of a 'who is a feminist'; how feminisms are practised vis--vis transformations in and through the body, dress (e.g. veiling) or fashion, gender-based violence and gender justice; what constitutes feminist knowledge (i.e. standpoint epistemologies) and who owns or produces such knowledge (e.g. those who inhabit the margins such as queers, masculinities, diaspora, cyborgs, etc.). The unit aims to enable students to reflexively engage with the relevance of feminist theorising and practice by critically applying concepts and questions of identity, agency and feminist praxis to contemporary debates, issues or concerns. Feminisms have relevance when it potentially questions assumptions or biases even prejudices, reviews existing practices, particularly those that lead to gender-based discrimination and violence, opens-up possibilities for providing solutions to a particular problem or redress to a social injustice or spaces of negotiation to a controversy or impasse.</synopsis>

<title> Management and leadership of professional nursing practice</title>
<synopsis> This unit examines the concepts of management and leadership as applied to the conduct of professional nursing practice. The content is delivered in four modules. The first module examines key professional and organisational structures that govern the scope and practice of nursing work in particular nursing contexts. The uses and roles of policy (development, utilisation and compliance) in assisting governance will be studied. In the second module, contemporary methods for the organisation of work in nursing environments will be examined including human resources management. These also will be considered in relation to industry and technology reforms; political, business and social agendas; and developmental strategies. The third module examines principles and models for strategic planning and operational interventions for the management and development of nursing services and work. The fourth module examines the role of interdisciplinary engagement and activities in relation to nursing leadership and management strategies.</synopsis>

<title> Translational research: pathways to the clinic</title>
<synopsis> Translational research is a growing and exciting new discipline in medicine that involves many pathways towards developing fundamental scientific discoveries into tangible clinical outcomes. In this unit, students will learn how to identify, critically evaluate and apply translational research processes including the drug discovery pipeline, market needs, intellectual property, commercialisation and/or clinical trials. Underpinning this training, students will learn to identify and critically appraise commercial and ethical decision-making crossroads. They will also learn how to communicate scientific findings to both scientific and non-scientific audiences by developing the ability to prepare a media release, a critical review of the literature and a scientific poster, conveying translational research. Translational research involves team work and leadership; students undertaking this unit will develop these abilities through engagement in a variety of team and leadership activities.</synopsis>

<title> General linguistics</title>
<synopsis> Language is infinitely creative, yet governed by a set of rules that speakers learn consciously and subconsciously. This unit focuses on making our implicit knowledge about language more explicit. It does this through the two-pronged approach of introducing terminology and notation systems for talking about language structures, and applying this knowledge to real-world language problems. Through a focus on phonetics and phonology (the sounds of speech) and morpho-syntax ('grammar') the unit gives students deeper insight into the workings of English, while also introducing data from a range of other languages for the purposes of comparison. Students also reflect on how utterances are given meaning (semantics and pragmatics) and the importance of contextual factors in determining whether an utterance is grammatically correct or appropriate.</synopsis>

Far from value-free, medical knowledge and practice is everywhere and always embedded in a social, political, economic, and cultural context. We will probe these entwined historical experiences through an analysis of the written texts, visual sources, and material artefacts left by patients and practitioners. The focus will be on the period from the eighteenth century through to the present, when technological innovation revolutionised medical care and life expectancy increased dramatically. Topics may include: patient experiences; medical professions and professionalisation; medical technologies and epistemologies; authoritative knowledge and power in the clinic and in the laboratory; medicine and colonialism; relationship between mind and body.</synopsis>

In this unit, students will travel to the heart of the world's media industry to observe how industrial crisis and creative responses are transforming news organisations, journalists and audiences in the American context. The program begins online in November, when students will delve into the history, structure, culture and products of leading and cutting-edge US and international media outlets. To follow, students attend an intensive workshop at Monash University (Caulfield) to develop skills in research design, methods, analysis and project management. Students will travel to New York to learn first hand how newsrooms are adapting to change. How have outlets responded to the pressures of changing consumption patterns, delivery platforms and business models? What is it like to be a media practitioner in the contemporary era? How are news values shifting to capture contemporary audiences? And are the foundations of journalism in a liberal democracy - notions of independence, objectivity and fairness - changing too?

<title> Leaders, power and politics</title>
<synopsis> Leadership is indispensable to politics. Yet leadership is a problematic concept within liberal democracies that have traditionally set out to devolve authority and check against concentrations of power. This unit explores political leadership within liberal democracies using Australia (prime ministers) and the United States (presidents) as its primary empirical reference points. It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.</synopsis>

<title> Medicine 3</title>
<synopsis> Through the theme based curriculum, this unit continues to provide integrated studies that build the foundations for commencing studies in clinical settings. A deeper understanding of the socio-economic context of health and illness, awareness of the non-medical services which support the practice of medicine, and improved health outcomes is developed. Ethical/legal issues relevant to professional responsibility, the doctor-patient relationship and public accountability link directly to future clinical practice. Students acquire skills in basic research, including data management and critical appraisal of evidence and knowledge which provide the basis for evidence based clinical decision-making. Scientific basis of clinical practice aims to provide students with detailed knowledge of selected body systems in health and disease. In the clinical skills component of the curriculum, students are expected to draw upon theoretic knowledge, and apply this during the development clinical reasoning, and the performance of key clinical skills tasks. An integral component of this unit is the weekly problem based learning activity (PBL). Each PBL integrates content presented to students across the four themes throughout the week.</synopsis>

<title> Current issues in statutory interpretation</title>
<synopsis> The first half of the unit will consist of an in-depth consideration of the main theories of statutory interpretation: intentionalism, textualism and purposivism. With regard to intentionalism, the focus will not only be on the standard arguments for and against intentionalism, but also on the deeper theoretical commitments of intentionalism. For example, intentionalism presupposes that there is a defensible notion of legislative intent. Students will consider not only classic (aggregative) theories of legislative intent, and the criticisms of those theories, but also contemporary (largely non-aggregative) theories. Students will also consider the current scepticism among judges on the High Court of Australia towards the concept of legislative intent. Similarly, with regard to textualism, consideration will be given not only to the standard arguments for and against textualism, but also to different versions of textualism based on different accounts of the meaning of a legal text. Consideration will also be given to Andrei Marmor's recent argument that, while textualism provides an accurate account of the meaning of statutory texts, few appellate court cases involving statutory interpretation turn on a correct understanding of the meaning of the relevant statutory text.</synopsis>

<title> Philosophy of research</title>
<synopsis> This unit discusses the fundamental epistemological premises on which HDR research may be developed. It explores ways of formulating research question(s) and hypotheses, and identifies assumptions and theories that are relevant in the development of a conceptual framework for research. The topics discussed will cover principles of the scientific method, key epistemological perspectives in the social sciences (e.g. positivism, interpretivism, social constructivism, hermeneutics, functionalism, critical theory) and argument analysis (e.g. avoiding fallacies in scientific reasoning, evaluating and constructing sound arguments). These discussions will clarify the theoretical and practical underpinnings of research design, inform subsequent analyses of how to select different research methods (qualitative, quantitative, mixed), and illustrate key issues associated with main argument development in a HDR thesis. Finally, the unit will examine ways of presenting a compelling theoretical and practical case for the epistemological significance of a HDR project, and examine how this approach could increase the likelihood of successful publication of research results.</synopsis>

<title> Environmentalism: A philosophical perspective</title>
<synopsis> Ethical issues which are raised by the environmental crisis stretch the traditional philosophical concepts, to breaking point. This has led to calls for a completely new ethic based on environmental values and a non-anthropocentric world view. The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. We examine issues such as: animal rights, the intrinsic value of nature and eco-centric notions of value.

<title> Modern Islam</title>
<synopsis> The unit examines developments in Islamic thought in the last three centuries. In many cases, this era has seen the breakdown of the classical Islamic paradigms of governance, leadership, learning, and social order, and the consequent development of new Islamic or Islamist ideologies and movements. Examples will be considered from both Sunni and Shi'ite perspectives across diverse landscapes. The lives and works of significant figures in modern Islamic history will be studied in order to understand the diversity of the ways in which Islamic thought has responded to the colonial and post-colonial age. The course introduces the pre-colonial background of the Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavid Empires, before moving to the colonial encounters, state reforms and emerging ideologies in the nineteenth century. The course provides an up-to-date introduction to various Muslim movements in the colonial and post-colonial period. The course materials entail selections from important primary sources, as well as audio-visual materials.</synopsis>

<title> The dark hero</title>
<synopsis> The unit is designed to introduce students to the development of the dark or satanic hero in a range of major English texts selected to illustrate the tremendous impact and popularity of this powerful figure. Writers since the Renaissance have created powerful and seductive heroes, anti-heroes and appealing villains who advocate and personify radical individualism, self-sufficiency and ambition, but who are often isolated, gloomy and dissatisfied by their revolt against God, morality and society. Special attention will be given to the gendered representation of the dark hero, particularly the persistent tendency to represent or view female characters who challenge moral codes in relation to prevailing social roles of virgin/whore, good/bad mother etc. The unit encourages students to examine the relationship between the satanic heroes, vamps and villains who appear in the unit texts and the many dark heroes of who have subsequently appeared in literature.</synopsis>

<title> Introduction to philosophy: Moral dilemmas and philosophy</title>
<synopsis> The unit is an introduction to moral philosophy. The focus of the unit is the ethics of killing. The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. We examine questions such as: When, if ever, is killing justified? Many of us think that killing is permissible in emergency rescue situations, or in self-defence. Is it possible to explain this in a way that is consistent with our more typical attitudes to killing? What about killing non-human animals for food? Like all philosophy units, this unit will also develop critical and analytic thinking skills. These issues are linked to the situation regarding life and death in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the ethical dilemmas (such as violent crime) encountered within this context.</synopsis>

<title> Marketing strategy masterclass</title>
<synopsis> This is the capstone unit of the Master of Marketing degree program. The overarching goal of the degree is to prepare competent and responsible entrants to the marketing profession. Accordingly, this integrative, end-of-program capstone unit will help in translating knowledge gleaned from all other degree units (i.e. the academic discipline of marketing) toward the professional discipline of marketing. This will be achieved in the form of "direct decision making scenarios" (case studies), "experiential learning episodes" (simulation), "competitive situations" (mid-term case completion), "learning from academic and industry leaders" (research day, marketing masterclass, marketing breakfasts), and "immersive learning events" (industry visits).</synopsis>

<title> Imagining Ibero-America: Travels, texts and transnational encounters</title>
<synopsis> This unit examines the ways in which Spain and Latin America have represented each other, and the 'singular cultural space' of Ibero-America, at critical junctures during the twentieth century. Through a range of sources produced on both sides of the Atlantic, including works of fiction, critical essays, travel narratives, journalism and film, the unit reflects on the supranational contexts in which (trans)national identities are negotiated and defined. Students explore such critical issues as notions of nationhood and 'race,' cosmopolitanism, immigration and exile, gender and subjectivity, and the confrontation of modernity with tradition. As a point of departure, students are introduced to the idea of Hispanidad and the ideology of Hispanoamericanism as a means by which Spain sought its national regeneration by proclaiming the shared spirit, language and culture that allegedly unites Spain and its former colonies. One of the recurring themes explored are the various responses to this idea of Ibero-America as a homogenous cultural space. Students will reassess critically the nature of post-imperial Spain and post-colonial Latin America from the aftermath of Spain's loss of empire in 1898 to the rapid increase in Latin American immigration to Spain at the end of the twentieth century.</synopsis>

<title> Digital humanities in action</title>
<synopsis> Digital Humanities in action provides a distinctive, transdisciplinary opportunity for students to synthesise critical discourse with practice-based application in ways that are characteristic to the field of Digital Humanities (DH). Through active learning, students will be challenged to advance their practical, technical and conceptual skills developed in preceding DH (and other disciplinary) studies towards a complex multi-faceted design research project. The design studio will provide the framework for students to apply their critical understanding and creative skills to problem-based scenarios. The practice-based opportunities provided by the studio will be supplemented by complementary theoretical and design thinking content and methods. Students will be required to undertake a project that demonstrates suitable application of knowledge and techniques drawn from their identified stream of specialisation (in digital media, information and society, digital cultural heritage). Students will be expected to respond in a critical, ethical and reflective manner, while exercising creative, entrepreneurial and independent research skills. Critical discourse will be agile and responsive to contemporary issues arising at the socio-cultural interface of DH scholarship. The resulting project work will demonstrate both conceptual and technical application relevant to their knowledge domain (Arts, Information Technology, or Art Design and Architecture) to a high level of competence and literacy. The nature of the studio environment provides a unique opportunity for encouraging interdisciplinary approaches to practice and research. On occasion, these studies may be undertaken as part of an immersive research studio conducted as part of special projects and study abroad experiences.</synopsis>

<title> Introduction to qualitative research</title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces students to qualitative research methods and why, when and how they are used in health research. The unit will develop students' understanding of both the theoretical underpinnings of qualitative research and the practical skills in research design using qualitative methods. In developing these skills students will learn about sampling, qualitative data collection and qualitative data analysis techniques and mixed methods designs in the arenas of clinical health service delivery, public health and health policy. The cultural, ethical and political contexts within which research takes place will be discussed to highlight that research takes place in the real world, which both enables and constrains research design and practice.</synopsis>

<title> Working with families across the lifespan</title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces the concept of working with families from a strengths-based framework. The concept of family strengths has been studied for several decades and describes a family that functions optimally in support of the individual members. When nurses and other professionals use a family strengths theoretical framework in their daily practice, they contribute to providing health care that focuses on the whole rather than only the individual and begin to support families when accessing health care. A healthy family may be stronger in one area than another, and strengths may overlap with each other. It is well known that the family environment may have a positive or a negative effect on individuals in the family, depending on the family's values, beliefs, and ability to manage change. The composition and structure of contemporary families are wide-ranging, and include families from varying cultures, with composition including single and extended families, and families at differing socioeconomic levels. This unit aims to bridge the gap in theoretical content related to family care across the lifespan so that nurses and other professionals can explore the factors that shape their capacity to develop caring relationships with individuals, families, groups, populations, and communities.</synopsis>

<title> Recovery principles</title>
<synopsis> Recovery is a new area of research within the fields of addiction and mental health but one that has gained considerable policy and practice debate in the US, UK and Australia, and that is closely linked to the desistance movement in criminal justice. This unit explores what is known so far, what the key issues are in this area, and arguments around the definition of recovery, and the merits of a recovery approach, with its origins in positive psychology, mutual aid and the patient empowerment movement. The aim of the unit is to introduce the concepts and philosophy of recovery, the evidence base as it stands to date and the challenges it poses to current interpretations of existing models, in particular expert-driven treatment.</synopsis>

<title> Modern political thought</title>
<synopsis> Modern political theorists grapple with significant political and social transformations such as capitalism, bureaucratisation, rationalisation and globalization. They diagnose various 'pathologies' they fear might result from these transformations: alienation and injustice, disenchantment and authoritarianism, nihilism and social disintegration. They also identify political solutions to these maladies: revolutionary action, charismatic leadership, new forms of democracy and citizenship, or new types of social movements. This unit examines and assesses modern political theorists' diagnoses of and cures for modern society, focusing on how they conceptualise key political concepts such freedom, power, community and legitimacy. It will do so by examining the political theories of Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Foucault, Habermas and other contemporary critical theorists.</synopsis>

<synopsis> This unit is designed to introduce students to the practices, requirements and expectations of university study and so prepare them to participate in the academic learning environment. It seeks to equip students with the academic skills, tertiary literacies and attitudes essential for successful university study. The coverage of a range of key skills ranging from academic writing to critical reading is unified thematically by a consideration of what makes university study different, the benefits of a university education and the development of graduate attributes. Throughout the unit, there will be an emphasis on the utility and transferability of these academic skills and competencies for employability, lifelong learning, and to other subjects undertaken so that students can navigate their own learning. Contextualised within themes and topics, lectures will situate skills development within current research, and highlight salient principles and practices. Tutorials will involve participation in a variety of tasks, focusing on discussion, assessment, application, practice and analysis of skills development in context.</synopsis>

<title> Design for additive manufacturing</title>
<synopsis> Additive manufacturing allows components to be produced with reduced weight, reduced part count, less scrap, and increased complexity compared to conventional manufacturing processes. However, components must be redesigned to take advantage of these advantages. This unit introduces students to the principles of design for additive manufacturing; the optimisation of designs; and the practical design-to-product workflow.</synopsis>

<title> Discourse analysis</title>
<synopsis> Every day, we engage with a wide range of different text types and speaking situations, from casual conversations with friends to news reports, medical appointments to advertising. In this unit, we look in detail at the typical features of these and other text types and explore the ways in which language can be used to manipulate, persuade or empower the hearer/ reader. The unit introduces students to a variety of approaches to doing discourse analysis, including Conversation Analysis, Critical Discourse Analysis and Corpus Linguistics. Students apply these methods to a range of texts and reflect on the appropriateness of each for answering different types of research questions.</synopsis>
