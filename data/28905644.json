Students will conduct a project-based study of aspects of traditional and modern Chinese culture. It introduces students to the study of Chinese culture, focusing on the characteristics of traditional Chinese culture, the interaction between Chinese culture and other cultures, and the uses to which Chinese culture is put in the modern world. The unit will use a range of Chinese-language and English-language material, sourced from mainland China and internationally. The teaching schedule will consist of bi-weekly two-hour workshops in which students will read and view scholarly publications (in English and Chinese) about Chinese culture, combined with weekly two-hour seminars based on in-depth discussion of the lecture material as it applies to the topics assigned for individual projects. Students will read and analyse materials and commentaries relating to traditional and modern Chinese art and literature and the social and political uses of Chinese culture in China and abroad, guided by the arguments, concepts and methods employed in the field of Chinese cultural studies. By introducing students to a wide range of scholarly materials about Chinese culture, this unit aims to strengthen their academic writing skills.",

We study the remains of houses, palaces, temples, pottery, tools, weapons, statues, and paintings, and we think about what they can tell us about the way communities organized their societies. We also incorporate the information we learn from written texts as well as from oral histories. Topics include human evolution, origins of farming, the growth of cities, the development of writing, the pyramids of Egypt, the complex societies of the Indus Valley, the Mycenaean kingdoms, and the fall of Troy. Hands-on tutorials explore the archaeological methods used to reconstruct ancient societies.",

Lectures and tutorials provide students with necessary knowledge and a platform to engage with this knowledge in an appropriately ethnographical and experiential way. These lectures provide insight in to Indigenous production in context of pre-colonial history, an imagined post-colonial trajectory through to its interactivity with de-colonisation and the onset of new materialism. Students will develop a deep understanding of the relationality that Indigenous culture has with the premise of Country, its impact on practice and its relationship to their own place and situated experience.",

The unit will begin by tracing Enlightenment debates about tolerance and difference that centred around the place of the Jews in modern European nation-states. It will then shift to discussing the social and economic positions of Jews and Muslims in 19th century North Africa, as well as the socio-economic mobility of Jews in 19th century Europe. It will finally move into the twentieth century and cover topics including the emergence of Zionism, the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel, decolonization and the emigration of North African Jews and Muslims to Europe, and contemporary debates about difference in 21st century Europe.",

The unit provides students with practical experience of Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tools and other computational resources (such as corpora and terminology tools). The focus on the international and technological framework for translation in a digital age will provide essential introductory knowledge about the localization industry and help students develop expertise in multimodal translation and the associated requirements, sensitivities, and opportunities.

Literary theory refers to particular intellectual approaches or frameworks that assist us with understanding, enjoying, constructing meaning from and discussing literary texts. This unit provides a succinct and practical approach to the topic of literary theory. It provides students with the philosophical foundations of modern literary theory, and also with informative and interactive seminars on the contemporary schools of literary theory such as Marxist theory, psychoanalytic theory, poststructuralist theory, feminist theory and postcolonial theory. The unit then instructs the students on how to apply these theoretical approaches to the study of their favourite literary works, and it also provides those students interested in creative writing with the opportunity to develop their own literary and exegetical writings according to the insights of some of the world's major theorists of literature.",

The unit provides an overview of the history of and theories in media anthropology and the specific contributions it can make to the broader field of media studies. It covers topics such as politics of representation, news, nation-building, religion, conflict, indigeneity and media activism. In this unit, we deconstruct common notions of active media producers and passive media recipients and analyse how media practices influence social and cultural dynamics (and the other way around) and question or redefine established social convention.",

It aims to help students integrate the diverse discipline knowledge and skills they acquired in prior studies and apply their learning to solve business problems. Students will identify innovative solutions to problems in a simulated experiential environment from a total organisation perspective. In the unit students are expected to bring together all the essential elements of running a business including strategic planning, leadership, ethical decision making, teamwork, cause and effect relationships between functional areas (research and development, marketing, production and finance), satisfying customer demands, and competitive analysis in a simulated learning environment. More specifically, students will learn the value of 'focusing' on the strategic implementation process, understand how decisions in one part of the business impacts other parts of the business, practice decision-making as a team across all key areas of a business, use the information from balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements to improve business decision making, analyse competitors' performance and market positioning and build core competencies within the business to take a differentiation or low cost position in the marketplace.",

They will learn about what cave art looks like across different regions of the world and from different periods of time, and the different kinds of theories and approaches that archaeologists have employed to try to make sense of this imagery. They will learn and be encouraged to reflect about how those theories concern not just 'other' cultures past and present, but also how they reflect on the preconceptions of the researchers themselves and their own cultures.

We explore how archaeological remains and historical texts can be used to study the movement of people and ideas and to identify the tactics states use to expand, strengthen, and celebrate their power, including military conquest, colonisation, trade, art, and literature. We examine the military ideology of the Assyrians, the internationalism of the Persians, the culture of classical Athens that built the Parthenon, the sweeping conquests of Alexander the Great, the hybrid culture of Kleopatra's Egypt, and the economic-military power of Rome under Caesar and Augustus.

This unit explores the rise of writing about music, and the many personalities who have long aspired to be the arbiters of taste, the keepers of standards and, in some instances, even the philosophers of their craft. Such writers have plied their trade in newspapers, journals, books, and, more recently, social media including Facebook and Twitter. By investigating key debates that have often sparked controversy and notoriety, the unit examines the role and function of music critics, broadcasters, journalists, philosophers, academics, magazine writers and bloggers, considering the agency that such individuals have exerted in the media past and present. In addition, students have the opportunity to develop key writing skills and produce work in print and digital forms.",

As feminisms are historically 'western-centred', the unit considers the ways in which these resonate with lived realities in Asia. As such, feminist knowledges and practices of 'women of colour' (e.g. feminist-postcolonial thought) are privileged in this unit. Highly interdisciplinary in its concerns, the unit examines fluid and contextual characteristics of a 'who is a feminist'; how feminisms are practised vis--vis transformations in and through the body, dress (e.g. veiling) or fashion, gender-based violence and gender justice; what constitutes feminist knowledge (i.e. standpoint epistemologies) and who owns or produces such knowledge (e.g. those who inhabit the margins such as queers, masculinities, diaspora, cyborgs, etc.). The unit aims to enable students to reflexively engage with the relevance of feminist theorising and practice by critically applying concepts and questions of identity, agency and feminist praxis to contemporary debates, issues or concerns. Feminisms have relevance when it potentially questions assumptions or biases even prejudices, reviews existing practices, particularly those that lead to gender-based discrimination and violence, opens-up possibilities for providing solutions to a particular problem or redress to a social injustice or spaces of negotiation to a controversy or impasse.",

In the second module, contemporary methods for the organisation of work in nursing environments will be examined including human resources management. These also will be considered in relation to industry and technology reforms; political, business and social agendas; and developmental strategies. The third module examines principles and models for strategic planning and operational interventions for the management and development of nursing services and work. The fourth module examines the role of interdisciplinary engagement and activities in relation to nursing leadership and management strategies.",

How have outlets responded to the pressures of changing consumption patterns, delivery platforms and business models? What is it like to be a media practitioner in the contemporary era? How are news values shifting to capture contemporary audiences? And are the foundations of journalism in a liberal democracy - notions of independence, objectivity and fairness - changing too?

Through an individualised course of study under the guidance of personal research mentors, participants will undertake projects using appropriate methodologies that demonstrate an independent point of view on the social, cultural, technological, and communicative aspects of design. The unit will enhance the combined creative and analytical methods of students as preparation for undertaking practice-based research while also promoting how processes of research and development can make an advanced contribution to contemporary design practice. The unit provides a unique opportunity for establishing interdisciplinary approaches to design research and the intersection of theory and practice. On occasion, these studies may be undertaken as part of an immersive research studio conducted as part of special projects and study abroad experiences.",

Yet leadership is a problematic concept within liberal democracies that have traditionally set out to devolve authority and check against concentrations of power. This unit explores political leadership within liberal democracies using Australia (prime ministers) and the United States (presidents) as its primary empirical reference points. It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.",

A deeper understanding of the socio-economic context of health and illness, awareness of the non-medical services which support the practice of medicine, and improved health outcomes is developed. Ethical/legal issues relevant to professional responsibility, the doctor-patient relationship and public accountability link directly to future clinical practice. Students acquire skills in basic research, including data management and critical appraisal of evidence and knowledge which provide the basis for evidence based clinical decision-making. Scientific basis of clinical practice aims to provide students with detailed knowledge of selected body systems in health and disease. In the clinical skills component of the curriculum, students are expected to draw upon theoretic knowledge, and apply this during the development clinical reasoning, and the performance of key clinical skills tasks. An integral component of this unit is the weekly problem based learning activity (PBL). Each PBL integrates content presented to students across the four themes throughout the week.",

With regard to intentionalism, the focus will not only be on the standard arguments for and against intentionalism, but also on the deeper theoretical commitments of intentionalism. For example, intentionalism presupposes that there is a defensible notion of legislative intent. Students will consider not only classic (aggregative) theories of legislative intent, and the criticisms of those theories, but also contemporary (largely non-aggregative) theories. Students will also consider the current scepticism among judges on the High Court of Australia towards the concept of legislative intent. Similarly, with regard to textualism, consideration will be given not only to the standard arguments for and against textualism, but also to different versions of textualism based on different accounts of the meaning of a legal text. Consideration will also be given to Andrei Marmor's recent argument that, while textualism provides an accurate account of the meaning of statutory texts, few appellate court cases involving statutory interpretation turn on a correct understanding of the meaning of the relevant statutory text.",

It explores ways of formulating research question(s) and hypotheses, and identifies assumptions and theories that are relevant in the development of a conceptual framework for research. The topics discussed will cover principles of the scientific method, key epistemological perspectives in the social sciences (e.g. positivism, interpretivism, social constructivism, hermeneutics, functionalism, critical theory) and argument analysis (e.g. avoiding fallacies in scientific reasoning, evaluating and constructing sound arguments). These discussions will clarify the theoretical and practical underpinnings of research design, inform subsequent analyses of how to select different research methods (qualitative, quantitative, mixed), and illustrate key issues associated with main argument development in a HDR thesis. Finally, the unit will examine ways of presenting a compelling theoretical and practical case for the epistemological significance of a HDR project, and examine how this approach could increase the likelihood of successful publication of research results.",

Examples will be considered from both Sunni and Shi'ite perspectives across diverse landscapes. The lives and works of significant figures in modern Islamic history will be studied in order to understand the diversity of the ways in which Islamic thought has responded to the colonial and post-colonial age. The course introduces the pre-colonial background of the Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavid Empires, before moving to the colonial encounters, state reforms and emerging ideologies in the nineteenth century. The course provides an up-to-date introduction to various Muslim movements in the colonial and post-colonial period.

Special attention will be given to the gendered representation of the dark hero, particularly the persistent tendency to represent or view female characters who challenge moral codes in relation to prevailing social roles of virgin/whore, good/bad mother etc. The unit encourages students to examine the relationship between the satanic heroes, vamps and villains who appear in the unit texts and the many dark heroes of who have subsequently appeared in literature.",

Many of us think that killing is permissible in emergency rescue situations, or in self-defence. Is it possible to explain this in a way that is consistent with our more typical attitudes to killing? What about killing non-human animals for food? Like all philosophy units, this unit will also develop critical and analytic thinking skills. These issues are linked to the situation regarding life and death in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the ethical dilemmas (such as violent crime) encountered within this context.",

Through a range of sources produced on both sides of the Atlantic, including works of fiction, critical essays, travel narratives, journalism and film, the unit reflects on the supranational contexts in which (trans)national identities are negotiated and defined. Students explore such critical issues as notions of nationhood and 'race,' cosmopolitanism, immigration and exile, gender and subjectivity, and the confrontation of modernity with tradition. As a point of departure, students are introduced to the idea of Hispanidad and the ideology of Hispanoamericanism as a means by which Spain sought its national regeneration by proclaiming the shared spirit, language and culture that allegedly unites Spain and its former colonies. One of the recurring themes explored are the various responses to this idea of Ibero-America as a homogenous cultural space. Students will reassess critically the nature of post-imperial Spain and post-colonial Latin America from the aftermath of Spain's loss of empire in 1898 to the rapid increase in Latin American immigration to Spain at the end of the twentieth century.",

Finally we will look at some of the developments of Plato's philosophy in neoplatonism.",

Through active learning, students will be challenged to advance their practical, technical and conceptual skills developed in preceding DH (and other disciplinary) studies towards a complex multi-faceted design research project. The design studio will provide the framework for students to apply their critical understanding and creative skills to problem-based scenarios. The practice-based opportunities provided by the studio will be supplemented by complementary theoretical and design thinking content and methods. Students will be required to undertake a project that demonstrates suitable application of knowledge and techniques drawn from their identified stream of specialisation (in digital media, information and society, digital cultural heritage). Students will be expected to respond in a critical, ethical and reflective manner, while exercising creative, entrepreneurial and independent research skills. Critical discourse will be agile and responsive to contemporary issues arising at the socio-cultural interface of DH scholarship. The resulting project work will demonstrate both conceptual and technical application relevant to their knowledge domain (Arts, Information Technology, or Art Design and Architecture) to a high level of competence and literacy. The nature of the studio environment provides a unique opportunity for encouraging interdisciplinary approaches to practice and research. On occasion, these studies may be undertaken as part of an immersive research studio conducted as part of special projects and study abroad experiences.",

The concept of family strengths has been studied for several decades and describes a family that functions optimally in support of the individual members. When nurses and other professionals use a family strengths theoretical framework in their daily practice, they contribute to providing health care that focuses on the whole rather than only the individual and begin to support families when accessing health care. A healthy family may be stronger in one area than another, and strengths may overlap with each other. It is well known that the family environment may have a positive or a negative effect on individuals in the family, depending on the family's values, beliefs, and ability to manage change. The composition and structure of contemporary families are wide-ranging, and include families from varying cultures, with composition including single and extended families, and families at differing socioeconomic levels. This unit aims to bridge the gap in theoretical content related to family care across the lifespan so that nurses and other professionals can explore the factors that shape their capacity to develop caring relationships with individuals, families, groups, populations, and communities.",

In this unit, we look in detail at the typical features of these and other text types and explore the ways in which language can be used to manipulate, persuade or empower the hearer/ reader. The unit introduces students to a variety of approaches to doing discourse analysis, including Conversation Analysis, Critical Discourse Analysis and Corpus Linguistics. Students apply these methods to a range of texts and reflect on the appropriateness of each for answering different types of research questions.",
